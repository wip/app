## Reporting security problems to WIP

**DO NOT CREATE AN ISSUE** to report a security problems. Instead please
send an email to wip.incident-response@martynus.net

## Security Point of Contact

The security point of contact is Gregor Martynus. Gregor responds to security
incident reports as fast as possible, but always within one business day.

## Incident Response

In case an incident is discovered or reported, I will follow the following
process to contain, respond and remediate:

### 1. Containment

The first step is to find out the root cause, nature and scope of the incident.

- Is still ongoing? If yes, first priority is to stop it.
- Is the incident outside of my influence? If yes, first priority is to contain it.
- Find out knows about the incident and who is affected.
- Find out what data was potentially exposed.

### 2. Response

After the initial assessment and containment to my best abilities, I will
document all actions taken in a response plan.

I will create a comment in the official "Updates" issue to inform users about
the incident and what I actions I took to contain it.

### 3. Remediation

Once the incident is confirmed to be resolved, I will summarize the lessons
learned from the incident and create a list of actions I will take to prevent
it from happening again.
