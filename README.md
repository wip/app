By default, WIP is setting a pull request status to pending if it finds one of the following terms in the pull request titles

- wip
- work in progress
- :construction:

The pro plan allows for [configuration](#configuration) of both the terms and the locations that the app is looking for the terms. The pending status can be overwritten by adding `@wip ready for review` to the pull request body.

:robot::postal_horn: If you use the WIP app we strongly recommend to [subscribe to the updates](https://github.com/wip/app/issues/89)

## Configuration

Repositories belonging to an account or organization with a Pro plan subscription can be configured by creating a `.github/wip.yml` file:

1. In the repository you want the configuration to be applied in or
2. In a repository with the name `.github` to apply the configuration to all repositories.

Two options can be configured

1. **locations**: any of `title` (pull request title), `label_name` and `commit_subject` (1st line of the pull request’s commit messages). Default: `title`
2. **terms**: list of strings to look for in the defined locations. All terms are case-insensitive. Default: "wip", "work in progress" and ":construction:"

Example:

```yaml
locations:
  - title
  - label_name
  - commit_subject
terms:
  - do not merge
  - ⛔
```

The above configuration makes WIP look for "do not merge" and ":no_entry:" in the pull request title, all assigned label names and all commit subjects.

You can also configure different terms for different locations:

```yaml
- terms: ⛔
  locations:
    - title
    - label_name
- terms:
    - fixup!
    - squash!
  locations: commit_subject
```

The above configuration looks first for :no_entry: in the pull request title and assigned label names. After that it looks for `fixup!` and `squash!` in the commit subjects.

**A Note About Term Matching:**  
Terms which contain only non-word characters as defined by JS RegExp [^a-za-z0-9_] are matched regardless of word boundaries. Any other terms (which may contain a mix of word and non-word characters will only match when surrounded by start/end OR non-word characters.

## About WIP

Besides being a hopefully useful GitHub application, the WIP app is also meant as a reference implementation of a GitHub app built with [Probot](https://probot.github.io/) ([source code](https://github.com/wip/app)). I try to keep the complexity low and the code easy to follow. If you are thinking of creating your own GitHub app, the WIP might be a good starting point for you.

Besides the code, I also made our [policies](https://github.com/wip/policies) good templates for your app.

The WIP is deployed as serverless application to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/?utm_source=wip&utm_campaign=oss). The logs are drained to [Logflare](https://logflare.app/), which also provides the data source for the dashboard you see on [wip.vercel.app](https://wip.vercel.app).

All revenue from the "pro" plan will be donated to [Processing | p5.js](https://p5js.org/download/support.html) – one of the most diverse and impactful Open Source community there is. I only added the paid plan to make the WIP a real-life GitHub App example. If you cannot pay but depend on the pro features you can add your account with an explanation to the [`pro-plan-for-free.js` file](pro-plan-for-free.js).

If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to create an issue.
